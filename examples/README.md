# Examples

New exmaples are welcome, please feel free to submit a PR with one! We are currently using Johnny-five since it allows the same code to run on a wide variety of boards with little modification.

### Board specific tips
#### Arduino
You need to make sure that your arduino is flashed with Standard Firmata. Instructions for doing so can be found [here](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Getting-Started#trouble-shooting).

#### Tessel 2
See the [tessel project website](https://tessel.io/) for all the documentation you need.
